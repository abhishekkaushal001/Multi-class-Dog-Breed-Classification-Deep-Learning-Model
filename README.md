# Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

The aim of this project is to build a Multi-class Dog Breed Identification Machine Learning Model using `Tensorflow` and `Tenserflow Hub`.
* We'll use `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for Data analysis, manipulation and Visualization.

* The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's best we use deep learning/transfer learning.

* There are total 120 breeds of dogs in the Training Dataset.

* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set.

* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we've to predict them).

# As per the Evaluation, Our Model is capable in successfully predicting the Dog Breeds in our data with a Accuracy of 80.05%
